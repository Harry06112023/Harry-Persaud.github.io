            <p>Guyana is a small country located in South America between Venezuela and Suriname that has a population of 765,860 residents within ten regions and is comprised of various ethnic groups such as South Asians, Mixed Decent, Indigenous People and Afro Guyanese people.</p>
			<p>The early history of the country is that it was divided by European powers since the Dutch people were the first to claim land followed by the French and British people.</p>
			<p> The British took over the country in 1814 which eventually led to Guyana being declared as a colony in 1831. Slavery was abolished three years later in 1834 which gave slaves the power to create their own businesses the way that they desired.</p>
			<p> A Gold Rush period took place in the country during the mid 1870's which led to an economic boom so that people can be able to receive jobs and have a high income to support their families.</p>
			<p> Independence from The British for the country was successfully achieved on Thursday, May 26th, 1966 thanks to the efforts of the "Father Of The Nation" Dr. Cheddi Jagan since various Guyanese nationals of multiple backgrounds were able to put their differences aside and come together as one.</p>
