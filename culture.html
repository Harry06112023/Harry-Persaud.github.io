        <p> Three of the major religions that are recognized and celebrated in Guyana are Hinduism, Christianity and Islam.</p>
		<p> Hinduism Is one of the most celebrated religions in Guyana because there are two special holidays that people like to celebrate throughout the year which are Holi and Diwali. </p>
		<p> Holi is celebrated to mark the beginning of the spring season by people playing with colors on each other in order to enjoy the festivity of the holiday and an individual person also takes some time to repair any severed relationship with a family member or friend in order for them to be on good terms once again. </p>
		<p> Diwali is a spiritual festival that takes place during the fall season in order to signify the victory of light verses darkness. People decorate their homes with using an oil lamp called a Diya while also honoring the goddess of wealth Lakshmi so that they can be financially blessed in the year to come. </p>
		<p> Christianity is another major celebrated religion in Guyana since people like to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus during Easter Monday by going to church and flying kites along the seawall in order to alleviate any type of stress that an individual person may have and it also helps to bring about a sense of peace. </p>
		<p> Christmas is the major holiday that is celebrated throughout the country since travel is at an all time high during this period because family and friends like to come home and celebrate by eating a very special Amerindian meat stewed dish called Pepperpot which is made with Cinnamon and Cassareep and is usually eaten along with Bread or a flatbread called Roti.</p>
		<p> Islam is a third major religion celebrated in Guyana because of two special observances that take throughout the year which are Ramadan and Eid Ul Adha. Ramadan is the most important religious observance in the year for Muslim people because they are required to fast for one month every year in order to show that they demonstrate self control and be significantly blessed to do great things in their lives. </p>
		<p> Another observance that Muslims like to celebrate is Eid Ul Adha which commemorates the willingness that Abraham had to sacrifice his son Isaac in order to show that he had loyalty to God. In the end it was decided that a Ram would be sacrificed instead since God realized that Abraham had already proved his worthiness to him. </p>
